**Do it the local way!** Starting with a local train ride from the CBD to the Langa township, you will become a part of the community by using public transportation to navigate the scenic city of Cape Town. Once in Langa, you will engage with the local commmunity and tour important areas by bicycle. Finally, you will travel by a public taxi to the neighboring township of Gugulethu where we will wrap up the tour.
<!-- This tour allows you to experience how locals use public transportation to navigate through beautiful Cape Town. We start off by catching a local train in the CBD that drops us off in Langa. From there, you will enjoy an informative bicycle tour and then take a public taxi to end the tour at Gugulethu. -->
 <!-- By utilizing these means of transportation, you will engage in a more active and local approach. -->
