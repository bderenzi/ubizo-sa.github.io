### The Founder

<!-- Siyabulela &quot;Sabu&quot; Siyaka was born and bred in Langa township, and growing up he always recognised the rich culture and closeness within his community, despite the harsh reality of apartheid. -->
Siyabulela &quot;Sabu&quot; Siyaka was born, bred, and buttered in the township of Langa within Cape Town, South Africa. He was raised in the rich culture and unity within his community, despite the harsh reality of the past.

<!-- Through this realisation, he founded Ubizo, which literally means "the calling’". Ubizo's calling is to share the richness of the townships’ vibrant culture and rooted history with the world.

In 2008, Sabu gathered his brand ambassadors, who serve as tour guides, and founded Ubizo Events & Tours.

As the Vice Chair of his street committee and an executive member of Langa Ward 53, Sabu has been a steering community member in the community’s housing development project. This has further enriched his knowledge of the ins and outs of the community. -->
